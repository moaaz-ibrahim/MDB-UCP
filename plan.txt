MDB plan 

applied Algorithms : 
BST,Recursion
------------------
functions and features : 

1. DB models : 
-we need to validate the passed model to make sure that it meets the standards (validation)
-after validation we need to save the models associated
 with the user Id in models.json (storing)
important note : 
user ID must be sorted and auto generated this
 is important because we need to apply binary search in the future. 
--------------------
Done : 
1.1 model Validation. 
under development : 
1.2 model Storing
